Would You Dare is a project submission for the ReactJS Nanodegree program in Udacity. It's a sample application designed to demonstrate how easy it is to build applications with ReactJS and Redux.

If you would like to simply download a build of the latest version, download and unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/forcize/reactnd-wouldyoudare-app/releases)

## Important

If you are a fellow Udacity student please do not use this project as part of your submission. You may look at it in order to take inspiration but do not take whole piece of codes as yours. Otherwise it defies the purpose of the program.

If you need any help or have questions with your project please let me know and I will give you a hand!

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/forcize/reactnd-wouldyoudare-app.git
cd wouldyoudare
npm install (or yarn install)
```

After running the install, run `npm start` to configure and start the ReactJS UI.

## Contribute
